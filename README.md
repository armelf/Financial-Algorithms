This repository proposes a bunch of profitable trading algorithms and trading ideas, designed to be **extensible** and **optimizable**. We focus more on Equity Market for the moment, but with time we will add more asset classes. There is only one algorithm for Forex Market, as we currently don't have enough experience on this market. I hope that the overall project would be of interest and that people will eventually participate and share ideas and knowledge as well, or at least **make improvements** to the strategies already proposed
